In Chinese cultural practices, believers often visit temples to seek divine guidance on various life matters such as health, career, and relationships. They draw a fortune-telling poem (籤詩) which are believed to reflect the deity's wisdom and insights. This project aims to develop an intelligent chatbot that provides divination interpretations.
